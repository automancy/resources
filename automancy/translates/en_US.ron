        "basic_prism_name": "Colouragy - Basic Prism",
        "basic_prism_desc": "If they're *malleable*, are they *separable*... And are there intrinsic relationships in colours?",
        "basic_prism_done": "Mhm, you were correct on this. These colours can be made up of different ones- colours add up 'brighter'- Red, Green and Blue make up the colour White. You wonder if there's other ways to split the colour... this should be enough for now though.",

        "basic_furnace_done": "Sure, it's red, it's hot and it... rocks? No matter, it does burn. You have created a simple device for that fuel to burn... other stuff. Hm, didn't some Prometheus guy... uh... you decide not to think about this too much.",
        "basic_compressor_name": "Alchemy - Basic Compressor",
        "basic_compressor_desc": "Grey Matter- when Blue Matter gets heated up- might have some uses?",
        "basic_compressor_done": "Aha, it seems that with some Grey Matter, you can 'compress' things. These ethereal... materials?- that you can create with this machine- seems to have some greater uses.",

        "basic_mixer_desc": "Blue Matter- seems to dissolve and absort whatever it touches?",

        "alchemical_assembler_desc": "These... alchemical... elements...? They seem to have more capabilities than the simple colours.",
        "alchemical_assembler_done": "You've devised a way to create an Alchemical Assembly with your lower-tier Basic Assembler.
It does need the White Mechwork as a basis, however... You wonder if there'd be other ways to create these mechanism. You'll need these a lot, probably.

Oh, you also found out that you'll need to somehow distribute items across large distances. You've figured out a way to 'link' these special two machines together- the link is not an equal two-way relationship, however.

You've decided to call one of them the 'Master Node' and the other simply 'Node'.
The Node will send a Request to the master node, and the Master Node will *extract* items from a Storage and then send it back to the Node, and the node will try to send it to its own target.",

        "philosophers_stone_desc": "Shiny and rare, bright and gilded. You want to make this an easier process before all else. You're not sure why yet, but...",
        "philosophers_stone_done": "Finally... your Magnum Opus. With this magical orb, you can turn junk into Gold- This is just what you wanted!
You're still not quite sure the reasons to produce Gold... It will be useful. It WILL be useful. It just looks SO magnificent. It MUST be of importance.
You've done a lot to get this stone, too. Surely it has other uses than just making Gold. Maybe not in this form, but with some tweaking...
